                <p>This is my portfolio, where I showcase my journey and development in interactive media design. This collection of work embodies my professional identity, shaped by practical experiences and collaborative projects.</p>
                <p>One significant learning experience was through Affinity Mapping, a method we explored in class. Initially, we analyzed "bol.com" collectively, identifying its strengths and weaknesses. Each contribution was integral to creating our first affinity map, highlighting diverse perspectives in UX evaluation.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, working in project groups allowed me to apply Affinity Mapping to various websites. This iterative process taught me more about user experience and design principles, highlighting the value of collaborative ideation and iterative design.</p>
                <p>Throughout this portfolio, you will find projects that illustrate these principles in action. From developing functional websites to crafting effective content strategies and establishing cohesive branding, each project reflects my commitment to delivering impactful and user-centric solutions.</p>

                <h2> Intern Assignment</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>During this assignment, I explored the job market for two specific roles within my profile: Front-end Developer and UX Designer. I reviewed 10 job postings for each role and distilled five key points that frequently appeared in these postings. This exercise helped me understand the common requirements and expectations for these roles, such as the focus on team collaboration, flexible work hours, and opportunities for growth.</p>
                <p>For Front-end Developer positions, I noticed an emphasis on working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. The UX Designer roles highlighted the importance of user research, prototyping, and designing intuitive interfaces. I found the Front-end Developer role particularly appealing because it combines technical skills with creativity, allowing me to work on the visual and interactive aspects of web development. I enjoy working with web technologies and constantly learning new things, which aligns well with the dynamic nature of this role.</p>
                <p>Next, I compared these findings with the function profile descriptions provided in the course material. I found several overlaps, such as the focus on teamwork, remote working opportunities, and flexible schedules. However, I also identified areas where I need to improve, such as gaining experience with Scrum and Azure, which are essential for both roles but were not emphasized in the job postings I reviewed.</p>
                <p>I then searched for internships that align with the Front-end Developer profile. I identified two potential internships where I could work with React and JavaScript, focusing on coding and design. These internships appealed to me because they offer practical experience in technologies I'm passionate about and align with my career goals.</p>
                <p>Finally, I created a video presentation where I discussed my preference for the Front-end Developer role and explained the differences between Bachelor and Associate Degree students. I learned that while both degrees require a solid understanding of core concepts, Associate Degree students need to be more focused on practical skills and direct application in the workplace.</p>
                <p>This assignment has helped me understand what specific skills and knowledge is required for my desired roles. It has also highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adapting to industry needs. I feel more confident in my career path and am motivated to further develop my skills in interactive media design.</p>

                <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I’ve learned a lot this semester in regards to front-end developing, I’ve don’t multiple projects that have increased my knowledge regarding coding and designing. 

                    One of the things that I’ve learned for example was Affinity Mapping, we did an exercise in class where we had to go to a popular dutch site “bol.com” and identify its shortcomings and what they might have done well. This made me see a completely different side of designing, namely the UX side, which I never really gave any thought. After this assignment we had to go into groups and do the same thing for  a website of our choice and exchange information with other groups. This helped me value feedback highly and helped us with our project at the time for Lighttown Speakers. 
                    
                    Another notable thing was creating a brand guide and content strategy for Eindhoven Rockcity, before this I’d never even heard of these words, turns out, they are quite important for designing. I never thought u had to put that much thought into brand identity and what social medias to use to find your target audience. This project and everything around it made it clear that u need a good understanding of your audience and how to appeal to them. 
                    
                    Lighttown Speakers project was a project where I really had to do a lot of the heavy lifting, I had to manage my entire project group, step up in case something went wrong like people not finishing their presentation on time. It taught me once again the importance of deadlines and how working under pressure can sometimes actually help you get things done. This project really helped me with being able to pivot at any given time. 
                    
                    Another big learning point for me was all the iterative designing and prototyping I’ve done, for example I’ve made a paper prototype, wireframes, actual websites and so on. Thanks to all the feedback I asked for I was able to make so many good improvements to my work. I asked both teachers and students for feedback so that I could make the best portfolio possible. 
                    
                    I also did a lot of research for example I did some AI research for Rockcity where I learned all about how AI could help translate work so that it could reach a bigger audience. This research taught me how to choose the correct tools for specific requirements.  
                    
                    At the end of my semester, I worked on my Pokemon Archive, a project using React.js to create an online collection for ones card collection. This was the most enjoyable part of the year for me since it was something akin to a passion project for me, unlike just a project I had to do because of school. I felt rewarded for the time I invested, learning a lot about API’s and how the function, and how to display this data in an intuitive way. I wish I had more than 3 weeks to work on this, since I saw big potential in what this could become. 
                    
                    Overall, I learned a lot this semester, with ups and down, I had to improve my technical skills, strategic thinking and how to appeal to basic users. Each project helped me understand my individual learning outcomes, why they are important and what I was lacking. I’m looking forward to further develop these learning outcomes in the next semester and beyond.
