                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>During our projects, I used WhatsApp as a main tool for communicating between teammembers and sometimes even stakeholders. </p>
                <p>With teammates, I used WhatsApp to coordinate tasks, share updates, and provide instant feedback. This ensured that all team members were on the same page. Whether it was scheduling meetings, sharing resources, or discussing project details, WhatsApp made it easy to stay in touch and work collaboratively, even outside of formal meetings. </p>
                <p>WhatsApp has also shown to be a very useful tool for keeping a direct link with clients. We could easily and quickly get into contact with our clients for potential questions or concerns and provide status reports. </p>
                <p>All things considered, WhatsApp's ease of use and capabilities significantly improved the communication dynamics of our project, resulting in a more efficient and effective workflow. </p>
                <p>During this semester, I discovered the value of using effective communication tools to improve teamwork and client relationships. WhatsApp enabled us to respond rapidly to changes and feedback, resulting in a more responsive project environment. I also noticed how important coordinated group discussions are for keeping clarity and coherence in the project. This experience has shown how important clear, consistent, and timely communication is in the success of group projects. </p>

                <p>Microsoft Teams was an important tool for communication that I used for my project, both for teacher contacts and internal group cooperation. It made a big difference in my ability to work well with others and maintain structure. </p>
                <p>I used Microsoft Teams in our project group to share papers, have discussions, and send updates. The group chat and channel features of the software made it possible for me to have structured discussions and quickly access shared materials. This made guaranteed that everyone on the team was up to date and could continue doing their work. </p>
                <p>As for contact with the teachers it was used as a tool for meeting scheduling, getting feedback, and answering questions related to the projects. I could share my progress, set up online video calls with ease, and get quick feedback from my lecturers. I was able to keep in line with the project requirements and make the required adjustments depending on the advice I received thanks to teams.</p>
                <p>All things considered, Microsoft Teams was essential in helping me to communicate more effectively and improve the productivity of my project process, which in turn allowed for smooth collaboration and regular help from my teachers. </p>
                <p>Through the use of Microsoft Teams, I realized the value of having a communication tool ready with easy access to other stakeholders. Furthermore, the convenience of organizing and performing virtual meetings with teachers gave a direct channel of support and feedback, which was extremely beneficial in developing a strong project. </p>

                <p>I set up an online meeting with my client Lighttown Speakers as part of the project so that I could have a thorough interview. The purpose of this meeting was to learn more about my client and to gain a deeper understanding of the project requirements. We scheduled a time that worked for both of us using Microsoft Teams, so all of the important players were there for the conversation. </p>
                <p>I made a few questions to find out the most important things I needed about their needs, preferences, and expectations. Through this dialogue, I was able to establish the project scope, align my design approach with the client's vision, and identify key areas for improvement. The information I took away from this discussion was really beneficial in guiding the direction of my project and ensuring that the solutions I created were tailored precisely to fit the objectives of Lighttown Speakers. </p>
