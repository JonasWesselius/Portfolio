                <h2>Wireframes Lighttown</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Lighttown Speakers, a club under the Toastmasters brand, needed a new website to improve their online presence and attract more members. The project aimed to create a user-friendly and engaging website. The design process required multiple iterations to refine the wireframe based on user feedback and testing.</p>
                <p>My task was to develop a wireframe for the Lighttown Speakers website, emphasizing an iterative design approach. This involved creating initial designs, gathering feedback, making necessary adjustments, and repeating the process to enhance the final product. The goal was to ensure the website met user needs and provided an optimal user experience.</p>
                <p>1. Initial Wireframe Creation: Developed the first version of the wireframe, outlining the basic structure and layout of the website. This included main sections such as the Landing Page, About Us, Partners, and Contact Us.</p>
                <p>2. User Feedback and Testing: Conducted usability testing sessions with teachers to gather feedback on the initial wireframe regarding navigation, layout, and overall user experience.</p>
                <p>3. Feedback Analysis: Analysed the feedback to identify common issues and areas for improvement. Teachers suggested that since target audience reach was a major goal for the website, we should consider SEO methods. This led to discarding the one-page design, which is generally poor for SEO.</p>
                <p>4. Mock-up 1: Updated the wireframe based on the feedback. This included reorganizing the website structure, halting the development of the mobile version for a while, enhancing the visibility of important sections like upcoming events and partnership information, and moving on to creating a mock-up using the Toastmasters brand guide.</p>
                <p>5. Second Round of Feedback: Conducted another round of feedback with teachers, focusing on the styling and colouring of the mock-up.</p>
                <p>6. Feedback Incorporation: Reviewed the second round of feedback. Key changes included establishing a consistent call-to-action colour, which became yellow, decreasing the brightness of images for better text readability, and updating the footer to be more user-friendly.</p>
                <p>7. Iteration 2: Implemented these changes to the mock-up, resulting in a more appealing website but recognizing that more work was needed.</p>
                <p>8. Third Round of Feedback: Teachers suggested several changes, including revising the main colours. The yellow felt out of place, so I went for a colour scheme aligned with the Toastmasters website, mainly grey and blue. Red was used for call-to-action elements, gradients were made more subtle, and distracting diagonal images were removed from the services page.</p>
                <p>9. Flat Colour Iteration: Some teachers suggested using flat colours instead of gradients, so I created an iteration with flat colours to evaluate this option.</p>
                <p>10. Final Review and Testing: Presented all iterations to the teachers. The final feedback was to use different shades of the colour scheme to reduce vibrancy. By adding white with varying opacities, I achieved a range of blue shades, creating the final version. Additionally, a Partners page was added to fulfill the website's needs.</p>

            <p>The iterative design process resulted in a coherent, user-friendly, and visually appealing mock-up for the Lighttown Speakers website. Each iteration incorporated valuable feedback, leading to a final design that met user needs and preferences. The final wireframe provided a solid starting point for the website development.</p>
            <p>This project highlighted the importance of an iterative design approach in web design. Iterative testing and feedback allowed for continuous improvements and ensured that the final product closely aligned with user expectations. I learned that flexibility and responsiveness to feedback are crucial in design. By asking a multitude of teachers and listening to their different point of views and continuously refining the wireframe, I was able to create a more effective and appealing website. In future projects, I will prioritize iterative design to ensure high-quality outcomes.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Portfolio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Throughout the creation of my portfolio, I ended up with an iterative design approach, focusing on the visual appeal through multiple feedback cycles. Here’s how I navigated through the process: </p>
                <p>1. Initial Conceptualization and Wireframing: 

                     I started by outlining the basic structure and content flow of my portfolio. This initial stage laid the foundation for subsequent iterations. </p>
                <p>2. First Iteration 
                    
                     I gathered feedback from teachers on the initial wireframe. Insights gathered here helped me understand i was on the right track but i needed to focus on my colours. </p>
                <p>3. Second Iteration: 

                    Incorporating feedback, I changed my colour palette and made a moodboard to fit the theme, i added a lot of content.  </p>
                <p>4. Third Iteration: 

                     Incorporating feedback, i changed my learning outcomes hexagons and adjusted the spacing arcoss the pages so its all matched. I was ready for development. </p>
                <p>Key Learnings </p>
                <p>- Iterative Approach: Using iterative design allowed me to continuously improve the portfolio, ensuring it met industry standards of usability and visual appeal. </p>
                <p>- Planning: Getting constant feedback from teachers made me realise how import planning is, not putting the projects first all the times is a good lesson. </p>
                <p>My portfolio creation journey shows the importance of iterative design and responsive feedback in achieving a professional and visually appealing outcome. </p>

The goal was to develop an intuitive and visually appealing interface for users to browse their card collections, so that they know what cards are in their possession without having to look for all of them. </p>
                <p>- Initial Wireframe: Explored design concepts inspired by the idea of a binder, aiming to recreate the feeling of exploring a physical card collection. </p>
                <p>- Iteration 1: Iterated on feedback to pivot to a book metaphor, designing an interactive interface where users can flip through pages to view their card collection. </p>
                <p>- Mock-up:  Developed a final mockup with a lighter theme, integrating vibrant colors and animations to simulate the experience of zooming into your collection for enhanced user interaction. </p>

                <h2>Stylescapes RockCity</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I had to create a stylescape for our project of rebranding Eindhoven Rockcity. this was one our first designing tasks so I was quite new to the tools used in this task.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless I came up with a design using elements related to rock music and the colours used by the brand, this was rather difficult since they only really had yellow and black.</p>
                <p>- Initial Stylescape: This was my first creation, using shades of yellow to have some differences and a rock themed font.</p>
                <p>- Iteration 1:  After some feedback from my peers I learned that they weren't a fan of the brown/gold so i go rid of it and i showed hexcodes of the used colours, I also ended up swapping a couple things around.</p>
