                <h2>Wireframes Lighttown</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Lighttown Speakers, a Toastmasters club, required a new website to boost its online presence and recruit new members. The project's goal was to design a website that was both easy to use and engaging. Multiple iterations were necessary to refine the wireframe in response to user feedback and testing. </p>
                <p>My job was to create a wireframe for the Lighttown Speakers website, focusing on an iterative design approach. This meant creating basic designs, asking feedback, making required changes, and repeating the process to improve the finished product. The goal was to make sure the website addressed the needs of the users and gave them the best possible experience. </p>
                <p>1. Initial Wireframe Creation: Created the initial iteration of the wireframe, which outlined the basic structure and layout of the website. This covered major elements including the landing page, about us, partners, and contact us. </p>
                <p>2. User Feedback and Testing: Held usability testing sessions with teachers to collect feedback on the initial wireframe's navigation, layout, and overall user experience. </p>
                <p>3. feedback Analysis: I analyzed the feedback to discover common issues and opportunities for improvement. Teachers advised that we examine SEO methods because reaching our target audience was an essential objective for the website. This led to the elimination of the one-page design, which is often bad for SEO. </p>
                <p>4. Mock-up 1: Updated the wireframe based on feedback. This involved rearranging the website structure, putting off development of the mobile version, increasing the importance of crucial elements such as upcoming events and partnership information, and designing a mock-up based on the Toastmasters brand guide. </p>
                <p>5. Second Round of Feedback: Provided further feedback of teachers, concentrating on the mock-up's styling and colouring. </p>
                <p>6. feedback Incorporation: We reviewed the second batch of feedback. The key adjustments included developing a consistent call-to-action colour, which became yellow, lowering the brightness of images for better text readability, and updating the footer to make it more user-friendly. </p>
                <p>7. Iteration 2: Made these previously mentioned improvements to the mock-up, resulting in a more appealing website while acknowledging that more work was required. </p>
                <p>8. Third Round of Feedback: Teachers suggested various adjustments, including changing the primary colors. The yellow felt out of place, so I chose a colour scheme based on the Toastmasters website, primarily grey and blue. Red was used for call-to-action components, gradients were toned down, and distracting diagonal images were removed from the services page. </p>
                <p>9. Flat Colour Iteration: Some lecturers suggested using flat colours instead of gradients, so I designed an iteration with flat colours to test this idea. </p>
                <p>10. Final Review and Testing: Showed all iterations to the teachers. The final recommendation was to utilize different tones of the color scheme to lessen brightness. I created the final version by adding white with varied opacities, resulting in a variety of blue colors. In addition, a Partners page was created to meet the website's objectives. </p>

                <p>The iterative design process produced a logical, user-friendly, and visually appealing mock-up of the Lighttown Speakers website. Each iteration integrated useful feedback, resulting in a final design that addressed user needs and preferences. The finished wireframe offered a good foundation for website development. </p>
                <p>This project demonstrated the value of an iterative design method in webdesign. Iterative testing and feedback enabled continuous improvement while ensuring that the final product closely matched customer expectations. I discovered that flexibility and response to feedback are key in design. I was able to design a more effective and appealing website by questioning a large number of instructors, listening to their various points of view, and constantly refining the wireframe. In future projects, I will emphasis iterative design to achieve high-quality results. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Throughout developing of my portfolio, I used an iterative design approach, refining visual appeal and usability through many feedback cycles. Here's how I got through the process:</p>
                <p>1. Initial Conceptualization and Wireframing: I began by designing the fundamental structure and content flow of my portfolio. This foundational stage established the direction for following iterations.</p>
                <p>2. First Iteration: Getting feedback from teachers on the initial wireframe yielded useful ideas. It highlighted the need of adjusting my color palette and maintaining consistency throughout the design.</p>
                <p>3. Second Iteration: After receiving feedback, I changed the color palette and built a moodboard to better match the portfolio's theme. I also showed more of the future content.</p>
                <p>4. Third Iteration: Based on further feedback, I improved the layout, focusing on the design of learning outcomes hexagons and altering spacing across pages to improve coherence and visual harmony.</p>
                <p>Key Learnings:</p>
                <p>Iterative Approach: By embracing iterative design, I was able to continuously modify and improve my portfolio, ensuring that it met high usability and visual appeal requirements.</p>
                <p>Importance of Planning: Regular feedback from teachers highlighted the importance of thorough preparation in producing a polished end product. It underlined the importance of finding a balance between significant content and aesthetically pleasing presentation.</p>
                <p>My path towards developing this portfolio shows the importance of iterative design and feedback in producing a professional and visually coherent result.</p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I began my SprintX project with the intention of building a digital archive for Pokemon card collections, with an emphasis on making an easy and visually appealing interface.</p>
                <p>- Initial Wireframe: I experimented with design possibilities inspired by the physical binder metaphor, hoping to mimic the tactile feel of browsing a card collection.</p>
                <p>- Iteration 1: Based on feedback, I adopted a book metaphor and created an interactive interface in which users could flip through virtual pages to explore their card collection. This iteration attempted to improve user interactions and navigation.</p>
                <p>- Final Mock-up: I modified the design to include a lighter theme, vibrant colors, and animations that resemble zooming into the collection, with the goal of creating a more immersive user experience.</p>
                <p>I became aware of the value of iterative design throughout the SprintX project as a means of improving user interfaces. With every version, I was able to get input, make adjustments as needed, and finally produce a product that was easier to use and more aesthetically pleasing. The progression of iterative designing and the process in creating an enjoyable and interesting user experience were demonstrated by the change from the first wireframes to the final prototype. </p>

                <h2>Stylescapes RockCity</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>For our project of rebranding Eindhoven RockCity, one of our initial design tasks was to create a
                    stylescape. This was a new experience for me, as I familiarized myself with the tools and techniques
                    involved.</p>
                <p>- Initial Stylescape: My first iteration incorporated elements inspired by rock music and utilized
                    the brand's existing colors, primarily yellow and black. I experimented with shades of yellow to
                    introduce variety and selected a font that resonated with the rock theme.</p>
                <p>- Iteration 1: Based on feedback from my peers, I refined the stylescape by eliminating brown/gold
                    tones that were less favored. I also included hex codes for the colors used and adjusted the layout
                    to enhance visual coherence and impact.</p>
                <p>Creating the Stylescapes for RockCity taught me valuable lessons in design iteration and
                    incorporating feedback to refine visual concepts effectively. Each iteration was an opportunity to
                    enhance the stylescape's alignment with the brand's identity and visual appeal.</p>
