                <h2>Brand Guide for RockCity</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>For our project rebranding, we had Eindhoven Rockcity as our client, part of this rebranding was creating a brand guide for them to follow. This document is supposed to embody the theme and vibe that Rockcity wants to give of. My role in creating it was quite broad, i worked on all parts of the guide to make sure everything was coherent and made sense. This is what i did per topic:</p>
                <p>- <strong>Introduction to RockCity:</strong> I provided an overview of who Rockcity was and what they do. Basically making it so that anyone who reads that part knows what their goal is.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Brand Overview:</strong> In this part I further explored the goal of the company by working on the mission, vision and core values of Rockcity. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Tone of Voice:</strong> here I simply referred back to our research and defined how they want to communicate to their target audience, my main takes for this were that it’s genuine, positive, inclusive and social.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Typography:</strong>  For this part I simply created a quick overview of what the chosen fonts would look like and what they would be used for.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Colours:</strong> The colours were already mostly decided beforehand looking at the logo, this being black and yellow, but i wanted to add on to this by adding a contrasting colour to the yellow, this being blue. I thought it would be a good call to action colour or simply usable for things that required the users attention.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Merchandise Guidelines:</strong> I didn’t work on this part, I only made sure that the end product followed the same theme as the rest of the brand guide which was already the case.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Logo Usage:</strong> For the logos i but them all in a nice visual representation on how they are meant to be used and how not. I also added a short text simply stating the short rules displayed in the visual.</p>
                <p>By working on each section i made sure there was visual cohesion, I wanted to make sure that since I was responsible for finishing up the final product, it was perfect and future stakeholders can reference to it whenever needed. </p>
                <p>I learned the value of thorough brand management and the necessity of consistency in spoken and visual communication when developing the RockCity brand guide. I picked up on how to effectively convey a brand's vision and values as well as how to capture a brand's identity through mindful design decisions like font and colour palettes. In order to maintain consistency with the brand's identity throughout all communications, this project also demonstrated how important it is to establish precise rules for brand elements. All things considered, this experience improved my capacity to develop effective and unified brand guidelines that are useful tools for stakeholders. </p>

                <h2>Content Strategy RockCity</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I once again took the lead in setting up a complete content strategy for Eindhoven RockCity. My key responsibility were assembling and structuring all content pieces to ensure that they were not only informative but also visually appealing. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Objectives:</strong> The goal was to provide Eindhoven RockCity with a template or guideline to follow in order to attract their target demographic. For this part i simply put this text in a good looking design similar to the brand guide.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Audience:</strong> I did not create the personas so all I did here was just putting them in the strategy.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Brand Message:</strong> The message was very similar to the tone of voice from the brand guide i created earlier so i could take most aspects from there.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Media-Use Research:</strong> Thanks to the target audience research we did, I was able to but a nice and easy to read graphic in our strategy to showcase why certain media outlets will be prioritized in this document.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Strategic Media Promotion:</strong> The planning was made according to the research done prior, this way it hit all the socials that the target audience uses, and it gives Eindhoven Rockcity an understanding of how frequent they need to be active. </p>
                <p>- <strong>AI Research:</strong> Lastly I conducted a research on AI tools to use in their content, seeing as they expressed they were thinking of including foreign fans as well, but they don’t have the resources to translate all of their content, this is what that research was for. </p>
                <p>Throughout this process, my goal was to establish Eindhoven RockCity as a vital player in the local music scene, building stronger relationships with fans, musicians, and industry experts.  </p>
                <p>Creating the content strategy for RockCity taught me important lessons about audience targeting, brand messaging, and effective marketing. I learnt how to develop appealing, coherent content that resonates to specific audiences. Exploring AI technology for content improvement helped me gain a better understanding of modern digital marketing tools. This project underlined the importance of strategic planning in accomplishing organizational goals while also increasing my understanding of promotion in the digital age. </p>
