                <h2>Website Lighttown</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Working alongside my partner, I developed the Lighttown Speakers website, where I undertook significant responsibilities such as designing and implementing the landing page and services page.</p>
                <p>I created a visually appealing landing page that functioned as the starting point for Lighttown Speakers' website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This involved using CSS to style elements and create an aesthetically appealing interface, adding JavaScript functionalities for improved user interaction, and organizing content using HTML to ensure accessibility and clarity.</p>
                <p>For example, I used JavaScript to dynamically switch between the language selections on the website. This is not working yet, but the layout is there; the translation logic is missing. I also used flexbox layouts and CSS grid systems to make responsive designs that would provide the best possible viewing experiences on a range of devices.</p>
                <p>I paid close attention to detail the whole development process to make sure that all design aspects matched Lighttown Speakers' branding and user experience objectives while also being visually appealing. Thanks to this the finished website looks cohesive and functional.</p>
                <p>I learned a lot about web development while working on the Lighttown Speakers website, especially how important it is to find a balance between practicality and aesthetics. My proficiency with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript had been improved by the experience, which also made clear how important it is to create designs that are user-friendly and responsive. This project also demonstrated how important it is to match branding and UX goals with web design in order to guarantee that the finished result matches the client's vision and satisfies the needs of users.</p>

                <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I created a dynamic portfolio that showcased my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript development and skills.</p>
                <p>The portfolio includes a number of important elements that demonstrate my skills. For example, I created accordions and hexagons in CSS to display information in a visually pleasing and structured way. These elements show my attention to detail in user interface design as well as my ability to develop tricky layouts. </p>
                <p>Adding embedded videos straight into the portfolio highlights my ability to use HTML to easily add multimedia information. This improves user experience and offers an accurate overview of my results.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, I included root color variables into the CSS code to make it simple to alter and maintain the portfolio's aesthetic. This approach guarantees consistency and enables fast changes across the entire website.</p>
                <p>I wanted to create a polished, adaptable portfolio that not only displayed my work but also showed my increasing front-end programming skills and abilities through the use of these technologies and design ideas.</p>
                <p>Making my portfolio showed me how important it is to blend practical usability with beautiful design. I gained knowledge on how to use interactive JavaScript components to improve user experience and CSS to build aesthetically pleasing layouts. Furthermore, the significance of scalable and maintainable design methods was highlighted through the use of root color variables. This project showed my ongoing progress in front-end development and underlined my ability to adapt to new design difficulties and successfully present my work.</p>

                <h2>SprintX Project: Pokemon Archive</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I had an ideal opportunity to gain experience with frontend development using React.js thanks to the SprintX Project. Motivated by my desire to learn and explore React in order to grow my web development skills, I choose to create a Pokemon Archive for my project. </p>
                <p>I concentrated on including important React features, such useState hooks for effective component state management, across the project. I also included a quick search function as one of the main improvements, which helped user experience by allowing easy navigation and fast access to particular Pokemon cards. </p>
                <p>I kept it organized by using components thanks to React, which ensured the a clean and easy to navigate code for the archive. Thanks to a pre-existing API i wa able to retrieve all the pokemon cards available, but the trick was to figure out how to properly use the API with the way it was set up. After a bit of trial and error I was able to make it work though. </p>
                <p>The project served as a great example of the value of performance optimization, as seen by the lazy loading feature I added, which loads Pokemon images as they become visible.</p>
                <p>In summary, the SprintX Project improved my grasp of front-end development and increased my understanding of React's potential for building data-driven, interactive online applications. My goal to use the abilities and information I acquired from this project to pursue a career in frontend development has been reinforced by this experience.</p>
                <p>I gained knowledge on how to organize a React application for maintainability as well as how to manage state efficiently with useState hooks. Moreover, using a third-party API and employing lazy loading improved my comprehension of developing effective, data-driven apps. This project reinforced my desire to focus on frontend development by demonstrating how React can be used to create complex web applications and boosting my confidence in utilizing it.</p>

                <h2>Github Version Control</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>GitHub has shown to be a valuable tool in version control management for my projects, supporting both solo and group development projects. I have worked both solo and in groups using GitHub Desktop, providing effective project management and code exchange.</p>
                <p>For example, I took the initiative to introduce my partner to GitHub during the Lighttown project, even though they had never used the platform before. I walked them through the fundamentals, including branching techniques and the use of tools like merging branches into the main repository and squash commits. With the help of this method, we were able to work on various project components simultaneously and without running into issues while keeping the integrity of the code.</p>
                <p>We implemented an organized approach to version control by clarifying the changes that were made and their intention through the addition of helpful comments to commits. This approach help with effective communication and teamwork amongst team members in addition to helping with project structure.</p>
                <p>In order to automate deployment, I also added Netlify into my repository. Any commit published to the main branch of our repository instantaneously updated the live website because Netlify was linked to it. By simplifying our workflow, this integration made sure that, without human intervention, our most recent updates were always reflected on the deployed site.</p>
                <p>I learned the value of efficient version control and collaboration techniques in software development by using GitHub. I learned things on how to effectively manage and combine branches so that team members may work simultaneously without getting in trouble of one another. By introducing my partner to GitHub, I was able to communicate technical ideas better and create a collaborative work environment. The importance of continuous integration and delivery was further highlighted by adding Netlify for automatic deployment, which guaranteed that our most recent changes were always live and decreased the possibility of deployment problems.</p>
